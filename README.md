## About Spectacular

Spectacular is a free open-source specification workspace for AI-assisted software development.

Spectacular gives coding agents the structured product context they need before they touch the code. Instead of asking AI to infer intent from tickets, chats, and stale documents, Spectacular keeps the functional specification as a living source of truth that is clear for humans and directly available to AI tools.

The built-in MCP server lets agents such as Codex, Cursor, and Claude read your specifications, inspect project changes, and pull only the context they need while they work.

[LIVE DEMO](https://spec.tacul.ar)

### Features
* Maintain the specification as change requests come in
* Give AI agents structured requirements through MCP
* Track progress as requirements move through delivery
* Document ambiguities and highlight blockers
* Effortlessly export to Markdown and HTML

### Roadmap
* More agent-facing MCP tools
* More export formats
* Dark mode for working late
* External documentation
* Browsable changelog (changes are already being stored!)
* Versioning, including a comparison tool
* Presence indicators and live updates
* Desktop app

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> Skip setup, updates, and backups with [Spectacular Cloud](https://spec.tacul.ar).

Spectacular is installed and configured like any other Laravel application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spec-tacul-ar/spectacular.git
cd spectacular
composer setup
php artisan serve
```

To upgrade, simply grab the latest code and run `composer setup` again.

### Migrating to v2

If you previously used Spectacular as a solo user, create or register the account that should own your existing projects, then assign any legacy solo projects to it:

```bash
php artisan spectacular:solo:migrate your-email@example.com
```

The solo migration command only claims projects that do not already have collaborators, so shared projects are left untouched.

### Docker

If you don't have PHP available, you can run the app with Docker. Once ready, you'll find Spectacular running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Upgrades are simple too - just grab the latest code and rebuild the container. The database will be preserved.

## MCP for AI Agents

Connect AI coding agents to Spectacular's MCP server so they can read the latest specification while they work.

Cloud endpoint:

```text
https://spec.tacul.ar/mcp/specifications
```

Self-hosted endpoint:

```text
https://your-spectacular.example.com/mcp/specifications
```

The MCP server supports OAuth where your agent supports it. You can also create a bearer token in Account integrations and pass it as an `Authorization: Bearer ...` header.

See the [AI-assisted development docs](https://spec.tacul.ar/docs/ai) for Codex, Cursor, Claude, and generic MCP setup examples.
